## Abstract

Traditional *Proof-of-Work* (PoW) protocols were originally designed around solo mining, where rewards go to whichever individual achieves the winning result first. As a consequence, miners with more efficient hardware capture a disproportionate share of rewards, causing smaller participants to **expend energy** without meaningful returns. This dynamic pushes the ecosystem toward ***centralization*** and mining ***monopolies*** over the time.

While mining pools mitigate some of this imbalance, they remain tightly coupled to specific blockchains or protocols. **FonkETH** introduces a protocol-agnostic *peer-to-peer* (P2P) networking layer that allows miners of any scale to *aggregate* their compute, coordinate work, and share *context-dependent* opportunities (e.g., miners with different capabilities or insights can contribute uniquely to the process). This approach enables **proportional reward distribution** among participants based on their actual contribution.
